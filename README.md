# OfflineBudgetTracker

The Offline Budget Tracker is a simple app that allows the user to log expenses from anywhere, anytime- even while offline!

## Description

This Offline Budget Tracker is a database made for users on the go. Simply key in your expense or income, and your budget tracker will store it! If you're online, you'll see your data written to the table and generated on the graph. If you're offline, don't worry- your data will be written to your budget graph as soon as you revisit when you're online!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Node

### Executing program

* Select either 'Add Funds' or 'Subtract Funds'
* Whether you are online or offline, your budget entry will appear on the table and the graph upon entry (or reconnection if the entry is made while the user is offline)
